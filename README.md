# 📌 Property 24 SQL Mini Project <br> Task Overview Data Engineering

# 🏘️ Project Background
This project focuses on exploring and analysing a large residential property dataset using SQL. The dataset simulates a real estate platform similar to Property24, containing approximately 100,000 property records across all nine provinces of South Africa.<br
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  >
The goal of this project is to practise data exploration and querying using SQL without modifying the dataset — mirroring a real-world data engineering constraint where analysts work with read-only production data.

# 📁 Dataset
- Property prices 
- Location (Country, Province, City)
- Bedrooms and bathrooms
- Additional property features

# 📁 Database Setup
```sql
CREATE DATABASE Property24;
USE Property24;
```

**Main table:** `property24_data`
**Total records:** 100,000 residential property records across 9 provinces

# 📂 Repository Structure
The 60 queries are organised across six files, grouped by SQL concept and difficulty level: <br>

| File Name | Difficulty Level | Description |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Property24_Foundations.sql  | 🟢Beginner  | Basic SELECT, filtering, and ORDER BY queries.  |
| Property24_Exploration.sql  | 🟡 Intermediate | Multi-condition filtering, TOP queries, and analytical thinking. |
| Property24_Count_Aggregations.sql  | 🟠 Intermediate  | COUNT aggregations across provinces, cities, and property features.  |
| Property24_Sum_Aggregations.sql  | 🟠 Intermediate  | SUM aggregations for property values, repayments, and costs.  |
| Property24_Average_Aggregations.sql  | 🟠 Intermediate  | AVG aggregations for prices, sizes, and income requirements.  |
| Property24_Analysis.sql  | 🔴 Advanced  | GROUP BY with WHERE filtering for complex business questions.  |

# 🎯 Project Objective
Use **SQL SELECT queries only** to explore, filter, and analyse the dataset.

This project focuses on:
- Extracting meaningful insights from large-scale property data
- Translating business questions into structured SQL queries
- Practising SQL querying skills across multiple aggregation types

# 📜Project Rules
To simulate a real-world read-only data environment, the following constraints were applied: <br>
 | Constraint | Status |
|---|---|
| Modifying table structure | ❌ Not permitted |
| Inserting new records | ❌ Not permitted |
| Deleting records | ❌ Not permitted |
| Updating existing data | ❌ Not permitted |
| SELECT queries | ✅ Permitted |

# 🔍 Key SQL Skills Demonstrated
- Basic SELECT queries & column aliasing
- WHERE filtering & multi-condition logic
- ORDER BY and TOP for ranking
- COUNT, SUM, AVG aggregations
- GROUP BY for grouped analysis
- Analytical business querying

# 📊 Key Findings
| Insight | Finding |
|---|---|
| 🏆 Most expensive properties | Western Cape contains the top 10 most expensive properties |
| 💰 Lowest average price (Province) | Northern Cape has the lowest average property price |
| 🏙️ Highest total property value (City) | Gqeberha recorded the highest total property value |
| 📉 Lowest average price (City) | Kimberley has the lowest average property price |
| 📦 Total records | 100,000 residential property records |
| 🗺️ Provincial coverage | All 9 provinces of South Africa represented |

# 🛠️ Tools Used

- **SQL Server** — database creation and querying
- **SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio)** — query development and testing
